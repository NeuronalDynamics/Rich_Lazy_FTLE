First, install my code here: https://github.com/meeree/kpflow, clone it, cd into the root, and run 'pip install -e .'
After that, run train.py, then record_stats.py, then interpret_stats.py, in sequences. 
Note you can interrupt record_stats.py in the middle of running it without worrying, since it saves new data and uses that if it exists next time.

# To clone pre-computed data:
Install git lfs and pull. Specifically, if the repo is already cloned, go to it and run 
E.g., on ubuntu:
sudo apt install git-lfs
or on linux:
brew install git-lfs

Then, in the repo:
git lfs install 
git lfs pull


If you add new big files, before commiting with git, do, for example, 
git lfs track data/sweep/*
